- Decorator Pattern : structural design pattern that attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically , providing a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality

- Notes :
. Use the decorator pattern when you want to extend the functionality of an object at runtime

. Use it as a good alternative to add all combinations subclasses ( to avoid class explosion )
