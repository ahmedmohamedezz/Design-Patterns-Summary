Strategy Pattern 
-definition : behavioral pattern that defines a family of algorithms , and encapsulate them .

- notes :
. when we have several behaviors(algorithms of doing the samething ) , strategy pattern let you delegate the behavior you want .

. it allows you to change behaviors at run time 

. it's also good for code re-use , since you can use the same behavior with all clients and still code it once

. strategy pattern decoupled the code , we can change the behaviors , add or remove them while not breaking the clients code , we can also change clients and behaviors code is not affected

. the client should be aware of all behaviors and the differences between them , so sometimes it may get complicated
