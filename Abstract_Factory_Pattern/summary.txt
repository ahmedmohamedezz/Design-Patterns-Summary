- Abstract Factory Method : creational design pattern that defines an interface for creating a family of related objects

- Notes : 
. Use the abstract factory when you want to create a family of related object , or when the system should be configured with a choice out of multiple ones , and also it can be used when the system has to be independent of objects creation

. Abstract factory decouples the client code from the objects it creates 

. In abstract factory we can easily add , modify , delete => the clients without affecting the choices the client choose from and vise versa ( also change choices )

. Abstract factory satisfies OO principles like : code to interface rather than an implementation , encapsulate what varies

. Abstract factory satisfies solid principles like : OCP , SRP , LSP , ISP
