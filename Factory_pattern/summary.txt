- Factory pattern : creational design pattern that defines an interface for creating an object , but deffer instantiation to subclasses so they can decide which class to instantiate

- Notes : 
. Use the factory pattern when you have to choose from several objects and create one of them 
. It also allows you to have different producers for different products
. Factory pattern satisfies OO principles like : OCP , SRP , LSP 
. Factory pattern obeys OO rules like : code to interface not an implementation , encapsulate what varies
